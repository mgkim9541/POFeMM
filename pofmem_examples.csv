1.11752716866399e-308,"I would describe myself as a very determined and highly motivated person.  I take my job seriously but able to see things in perspective and I'm very easy-going to work with. I am an optimist rather than pessimist and cope well when the going gets tough; I am also very good at finding solutions to problems. Above all, I would like to say I relish a challenge.
I would also like to add that your stay and experience is of the utmost importance to me, therefore I am available before the booking and during the stay to answer all your concerns and anxieties.  For example where one would go to eat and taste the local culinary delights, easy and cheap ways to travel around London (this can be a daunting experience – believe me!)
A little about the apartments, houses and the rooms that you will stay in.  Firstly there are no hidden charges for the use of any utilities (gas, electric, water, Internet).  Linens are provided during your stay and there is access to a fully working kitchen and laundry facilities. 
What is my customer service philosophy?
I believe the customer is central to everything I do.  I therefore consequently attach a lot of importance to customer service.  I believe I have strong customer service skills – and working with the public is certainly something I look forward to and enjoy.
